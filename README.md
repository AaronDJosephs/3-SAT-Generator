# 3-SAT-Generator
Generates a 3-sat instance. Will eventually be part of a larger project; will be used to help generate Mario levels. 

Essentially a single function. The generator will prompt the user for an m (number of clauses) and a n (number of variables), and then will generate a single 3-SAT instance that has the correct number of clauses and number of variables.

The generator is functional, and will also include a test to see if the instance is solvable. 

The test is the simple exponential solution, but that is acceptable for these purposes.
